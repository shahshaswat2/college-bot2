# college-bot2

Students of Parul University often tend to login to PUMIS.in website and check their attendance on daily basis which requires multiple click points to pass and also consumes lot of time. This Python app automates all the stuff and with just one single click now you can know your attendance.

I'm trying to figure out how to make this bot work without any click by alloting some time period to keep on checking attendance again and again and notifying by some kind of text message or something, so feel free to submit any pull request.
